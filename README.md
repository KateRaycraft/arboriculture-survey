# Arboriculture Survey
An Ontario-based survey of employers and employees in the tree care sector, also known as the arboriculture industry. The survey data was collected via Google surveys in Fall 2017 by me, Kate Raycraft, and my colleague Courtney McCann.  The project is a partnership between the Ontario Ministry of Advanced Training, Education, and Skills Development (MAESD) and Tree Canada.
